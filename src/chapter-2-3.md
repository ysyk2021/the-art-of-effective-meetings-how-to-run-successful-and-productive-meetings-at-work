In this chapter, we explore the importance of self-reflection and assessment in improving our personal approach to meetings. By examining our meeting habits, behaviors, and attitudes, we can identify areas for growth and develop strategies to enhance our effectiveness as meeting participants and leaders. Self-assessment allows us to become more conscious of our contributions and create meaningful changes to promote successful and productive meetings.

1\. **Reflecting on Meeting Performance**
----------------------------------------

Take time to reflect on your past experiences as a meeting participant or leader. Consider the meetings you have attended or facilitated and evaluate their effectiveness. Ask yourself questions such as:

* Did I actively participate and contribute to discussions?
* Did I come prepared with relevant information and materials?
* Was I respectful and inclusive towards others' ideas and perspectives?
* Did I effectively manage my time and stay focused on the agenda?
* Did I follow up on action items and commitments?

Honest reflection on your meeting performance helps identify areas where improvement is needed.

2\. **Identifying Strengths and Weaknesses**
-------------------------------------------

Assess your strengths and weaknesses in relation to meetings. Acknowledge your areas of expertise, such as subject matter knowledge or strong facilitation skills, that contribute positively to meetings. Similarly, recognize any weaknesses or challenges you face, such as difficulty in managing conflicts or a tendency to dominate discussions. Understanding your strengths and weaknesses enables you to leverage your strengths and work on improving weak areas.

3\. **Seeking Feedback from Others**
-----------------------------------

Feedback from colleagues and teammates provides valuable insights into your meeting performance. Ask for feedback from trusted individuals who have observed your participation or facilitation in meetings. Inquire about specific aspects of your performance, such as communication style, collaboration skills, or decision-making approach. Constructive feedback helps you gain external perspectives and identify blind spots that may hinder productive meeting engagement.

4\. **Developing Actionable Goals**
----------------------------------

Based on your self-reflection and feedback received, establish actionable goals to improve your meeting approach. Set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals that target areas requiring development. For example:

* Improve active listening skills by asking clarifying questions during meetings.
* Enhance time management by allocating specific time slots for each agenda item.
* Cultivate inclusivity by encouraging quieter participants to share their opinions.

By setting clear goals, you create a roadmap for personal growth in meetings.

5\. **Acquiring Meeting Skills and Knowledge**
---------------------------------------------

Continual learning and development are essential for improving meeting effectiveness. Invest in acquiring meeting-related skills and knowledge through workshops, courses, books, or online resources. Explore topics such as facilitation techniques, problem-solving methods, effective communication, or conflict resolution. Broadening your understanding of meeting dynamics equips you with tools and strategies to navigate various meeting scenarios successfully.

6\. **Practicing Mindfulness in Meetings**
-----------------------------------------

Developing mindfulness in meetings involves being fully present, attentive, and aware of your actions and reactions. Cultivate self-awareness during meetings by monitoring your emotions, body language, and engagement levels. Practice active listening, demonstrate respect for others' perspectives, and avoid distractions such as multitasking. Mindful participation fosters meaningful connections, better decision-making, and improved overall meeting experiences.

7\. **Evaluating Progress and Adjusting Accordingly**
----------------------------------------------------

Regularly evaluate your progress in implementing changes to your meeting approach. Assess the impact of your efforts on meeting outcomes, participant engagement, and overall productivity. Make adjustments as necessary to stay aligned with your goals. Celebrate successes and reflect on lessons learned from challenges encountered. Continuous evaluation and adjustment ensure that your personal approach to meetings remains effective and continually improves.

In summary, assessing your personal approach to meetings allows for self-awareness and growth as a meeting participant or leader. By reflecting on your meeting performance, identifying strengths and weaknesses, seeking feedback from others, setting actionable goals, acquiring meeting skills and knowledge, practicing mindfulness, and evaluating progress, you can enhance your effectiveness in meetings. Taking deliberate steps towards personal improvement contributes to running successful and productive meetings at work.
